title: ⚡ How Referral Work
---

- **Mappedswap’s Referral Program** adopts an unlimited hierarchical model. The referrer not only earns a commission directly from referred users but also can indefinitely trace the transaction volume of indirectly referred users to boost the referrer’s rebate level and commission. As long as your rebate level is high, you can earn crypto assets without making any transaction!

- The referral model: for example, if A refers B and C, B refers E and F, while C refers G, H, and so on… Then B and C are the directly referred users of A, whereas E, F, G, H… are the indirectly referred users of A.

- [Fees](https://docs.mappedswap.io/docs/Cross-Margin%20Swap%20Trading/FeesandLiquidations/) will be rebated to traders and referrers.
- The latest rebate program can be found on [Referral Page](https://app.mappedswap.io/referral).

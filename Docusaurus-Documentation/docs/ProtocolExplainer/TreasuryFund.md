All the income (including the transaction fee and borrowing fee incurred by protocol users) will enter into the treasury fund of MappedSwap Protocol. The treasury fund acts as:

- **Friends Referral Program:** Distribute the rebates to the referrers for any successful referrals according to the [Referral Program](https://app.mappedswap.io/referral).

- **Collateral Vault:** After the payout to referrals is processed, 50% of the total income received (transaction fees and borrowed fees incurred by users) will be added to the treasury fund of MappedSwap Protocol, this fund will act as a collateral vault to pay for all levered losses with 80 million in value to prevent bankruptcies and making whole all positions.

- **MappedSwap Tokens (MST) Buyback Executor:** While the other 50% will be allocated to process the buyback of MST tokens in the open market. Once the treasury fund reaches 80 million, 100% of the income received will be allocated for further buyback process, after the payout of referrals.
